### UNC Coding Bootcamp Week 4 Homework Project

Week 4 introduces the use of JQuery and manipulating elements in the DOM.  The project was built with:

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* JQuery

Here is how to play this game:

There will be a random number generated at the beginning of the game that is between 19-120. There will also be 4 crystals, each with it's own randomly generated number between 1 - 12. Each time the play clicks a crystal, it's number value is added to the player's score. All DOM elements are updated through the use of JQuery.

* Conditions for winning/losing:
    * If the player can match their score with the number generated by the computer, the player wins.
    * If the player's score goes over that number, then they lose.  
    * The player's score is updated on the page as well as the number of wins and losses.
